# Feedback

Hello Ada,

I hope this email finds you well :)

I‚Äôve finally heard from one of our reviewers and I‚Äôm afraid there‚Äôs still a lot more to be done on the article. I admit, the feedback may be a bit too critical, but we have a strict reviewing process and only really just want to help you get an awesome article out there! ;)

Please read through and let me know if anything is unclear or you have any questions. Other than that, I‚Äôm looking very much forward to a second draft! üòÅ

I noticed the following:

The article starts with this sentence, "A web app is a website; A website so good users will be unable to tell it is not a first class citizen on the device."  This sentence doesn't tell me anything about the article or where it is going.  It is also overly complex and the author should not use a capital A after the semi-colon.

The second paragraph of the article starts with, "An ideal web app, should have the best aspects of the web and a native app."  This is the first sentence of the article.  The author could just cut the first paragraph and this would work much better.  They should also remove the comma from this sentence.

The article says, "It should be app-like in that it is fast and quick to interact with the user. It perfectly fits the device‚Äôs viewport regardless of device orientation; it should be usable when the device is offline and be able to have an icon on the homescreen."  This sentence could be much simpler.  Something like, "A great web app should be fast and quick to interact with, fit the device's viewport, remain usable offline, and support an icon on the home screen."

The article says, "Like the web it should work well across platforms, it should not focus solely on mobile; it should behave just as well on a Desktop computer as on mobile."  This sentence needs to be reworked.  It doesn't have correct parallelism and it doesn't need the semi-colon.

The article says, "Progressive Web Apps are not new."  Web apps should not be capitalized here.  This is a pervasive issue in the article.

The article says, "Some people get concerned with how the app will get exposure if not in the app store."  This is a very passive sentence and it doesn't actually say anything.  The author needs to provide a better introduction to this section.

The "But it‚Äôs not in an App Store" section is very confusing.  The author seems to be making the point that your application will not suffer if it isn't in the app store.  However, I don't know why the author is making that point here and they don't make it well.  As an app developer the app store is a means to an end more than an end in and of itself.  It is also a strange place to have this section since they haven't made an alternative proposal yet.

The article says, "Allowing us to remove the configuration out of the head."  This sentence need to make it clear that it refers to the HEAD tag in the HTML file.

The article says, "In Chrome 40 (December 2014) Service Workers started to be rolled out across Firefox and Chrome..."  The article needs to define what service workers are and why the reader should care.  The sentence also goes on to say, "...nothing on Safari at the time of writing."  Safari is the default browser on a major mobile platform.  The author can't just gloss over lack of support on that platform.

The article says, "Building in app based on the new Service Workers and Web App manifest became known as a Progressive Web Apps."  I think the author meant "an app" instead of "in app."  The author also needs to do a better job of introducing this new term Progressive Web Apps.  That is the title of the article.  They should have introduced it and defined it much earlier.

The "At what point does a website become a Web App?" section uses bullet lists with icons for the bullet points.  That doesn't match the Smashing guidelines and it is distracting from the article.  

The article says, "Offline first - The app must be capable of starting offline and still display useful information."  This is a good example of some fundamental problems in this article.  The author doesn't provide and tips or help for how to make an app that is capable of starting offline.  They don't make it clear why you would or wouldn't want to make your app work this way.  They are just stating a vague idea.

I am now at the "Taking your website offline" section and I'm going to stop making comments about smaller issues in this article.  See the next section for larger suggestions.

What is missing and how can the article be improved?

At this point I've just read up to the first section entitled "But it‚Äôs not in an App Store" and I have no idea what this article is about.  I understand that the author is in favor of web apps, but they haven't defined what exactly that is or what helpful information this article is going to teach me.  I have no reason to keep reading since I have no hint or preview of what the payoff will be.

The article needs a stronger introduction telling me what to expect and why I should keep reading.

I have now finished reading the article.  

This article covers a very interesting topic.  Everyone who has ever considered writing a mobile app has wondered which platforms they need to support and how they can get more coverage without writing separate native applications.  Writing a single web based application that could act as a strong mobile app would be a large advantage.

However, this article doesn't tell you how to do that.  The first issue is that many larger players have decided that native apps are better than web based apps.  There is an often-read article about this subject from Facebook here:

https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-rebuilding-facebook-for-ios/10151036091753920

The company Basecamp tried many different variations before they came up with a native navigation and web content strategy.  They wrote about it here:

The author needs to address this issue.  Many large companies in our industry have decided to write native apps.  The article needs to address why they decided to do that, if they were wrong, and what has changed to make writing a web based app more desirable.  

Once the author has answered these concerns about writing a web-based app they need to move on and provide helpful information for how to do that.  Most Smashing Magazine readers will know how to make a website, but they won't know how to make a web based app.  For example, the author mentions that you need to make your app responsive, but they don't mention how to do that.  What does the app author need to consider?  How can your single page scale well from a giant desktop to an iPhone?  The author needs to answer these questions and more before this article is useful.

Any further ideas, suggestions, remarks?

The author needs to be careful about using the passive voice.  Many of the sentences in this article are very passive.

The author also needs to use fewer semi-colons.  There are three semi-colons in just the first two paragraphs.  The author should strongly consider reworking some of their sentences.
